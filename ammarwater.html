    <p>We have been able to help many people in need because of all your continuous support, and we have accomplished reaching our goal for building a water well in Yemen. we are build water pumps in Pakistan which provides a sustainable water resource for the underprivileged people in the region of Tharparkar.<br><br>

      Tharparkar, Pakistan is one of the most insecure regions of Pakistan, as they experience frequent droughts and as a result, the climate has led to disastrous consequences for the residents as their main source of income is derived from farming and agriculture. The majority of residents in this region do not have access to clean drinking water.<br><br>

      It is so easy to forget what a privilege it is to have access to drinking water at all times. An average person wastes approximately 30 gallons of water a day. Having the access to water can make a world’s difference to these innocent people.<br><br>


      The gift of water saves lives, which is a hugely rewarded action! Allah says “And whoever saves one (A life) - it is as if he had saved all of mankind” (Quran, 5:32). Imagine this - every single time the clean water you have donated by paying 300 $ saves someone’s life, it is as if you have saved all of mankind! As Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) has also stated, the best charity is to give water to drink. </p>
